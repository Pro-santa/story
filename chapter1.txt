This is the title of my story, hope you injoy it.
it is a story of a person who wants to do something in his life not just like other people's are building their lives with happiness and prosperity, but something different. That's where I camein with this thought "I should go to a abroad for my further studies apart from my sexual atraction for those kind of women, I really want to do something in my life, what the other peoples are missing for their intire life. Because in our education system we should think what we really want in the life, and what we have to do, for basically achieving in that particular goal we need to understand this kind of thing are mostly matter to me the most. I really admired that other people's are giving me their valuable time and precious opinion, but it always depends on me what i am going to really do in this kind of situation thats occured in the life. So thats it fo today I really thanked god for giving me this Idea in such a young age, bye
